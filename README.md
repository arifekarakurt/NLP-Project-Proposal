##Author Identfication
###Description

This project aims at identifying the author of a given text. There are a lot of texts in electronic form due to growing world wide web. Anyone can copy someone else's text and put it on the web with his or her name. Therefore, author identification is becoming an important application on the web. I will use character n-grams for determining the authorship.
